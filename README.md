# Brave User Studies Extension

## About
This is a purely opt-in browser extension helping us to collect information about online user behaviour in a respectful and transparent way. The project contains the browser extension and the collection server. For instructions see the README files in the respective directory.


**Note: We will not accept and immediately delete all data that is submitted by non-verified participants!**

## Downloads
Downloads are done via the Chrome Web Store. Brave Software team members will provide end-users with an official link to the extension (after an application process).
