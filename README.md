# Brave User Studies Extension

This is a purely opt-in browser extension helping us to collect information about online user behaviour in a respectful and transparent way. Please do not install this extension if you obtained the link from anywhere else but the Brave community. If you have any questions feel free to reach out to us at user-studies@brave.com.

The project contains the browser extension and the collection server. For instructions see the README files in the respective directory.
